PROCESS FLOW
------------

Step 1: Continuous Data Collection
- ENDPOINT-MONITOR captures computer activity in real-time
- EMAIL-ARCHIVE processes all corporate emails
- NETWORK-MONITOR logs all network traffic
- TIME-TRACK-DB records clock in/out events
- PHYSICAL-ACCESS logs badge swipes
- CCTV-SYSTEM records video footage
- Purpose: Gather comprehensive activity data

Step 2: Data Aggregation
- All monitoring data flows to PROD-ANALYTICS
- Employee ID used as common key
- Data normalized and timestamped
- Purpose: Create unified employee activity profile

Step 3: Productivity Analysis
- PROD-ANALYTICS calculates productivity metrics:
  * Active work time vs idle time
  * Application usage patterns (productive vs non-productive)
  * Email and meeting load
  * Focus time availability
  * After-hours work patterns
- Data used: All monitoring sources
- Purpose: Identify productivity trends and issues

Step 4: Behavioral Baseline Creation
- THREAT-DETECT establishes normal behavior patterns
- Metrics: Typical login times, application usage, data access patterns
- Machine learning models trained on historical data
- Purpose: Enable anomaly detection

Step 5: Anomaly Detection
- THREAT-DETECT compares current activity to baseline
- Flags deviations: unusual login times, excessive data downloads, 
  unauthorized access attempts, suspicious email patterns
- Risk scores calculated
- Purpose: Identify potential insider threats or policy violations

Step 6: Alert Generation
- High-risk anomalies trigger security alerts
- Alerts sent to: Security team, HR (if policy violation)
- Data included: Employee ID, anomaly description, risk score, evidence
- Purpose: Enable timely intervention

Step 7: Investigation
- Security/HR team reviews alerts
- Access detailed logs from monitoring systems
- Interview employee if necessary
- Determine if legitimate business activity or policy violation
- Purpose: Verify and respond to potential issues

Step 8: Performance Review Integration
- Productivity metrics exported to PERF-MGMT-DB
- Managers access aggregated productivity data
- Used as input for performance reviews (not sole factor)
- Purpose: Inform performance evaluations

Step 9: Reporting and Analytics
- Weekly productivity reports generated
- Department-level aggregations (not individual tracking)
- Trends identified: productivity dips, resource needs
- Executive dashboard with company-wide metrics
- Purpose: Business intelligence and resource planning
