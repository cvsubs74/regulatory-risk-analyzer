# Business Process: Multi-National Healthcare Research and Clinical Trial Data Sharing

## Purpose
This process facilitates collaborative medical research by aggregating patient data from multiple healthcare providers and sharing de-identified datasets with pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, and government health agencies for drug development, disease surveillance, and public health initiatives.

## Processing Activities

### Data Collection
Primary healthcare systems:
- **Electronic Health Records (EHR) System**: Contains comprehensive patient data including MedicalHistory, PrescriptionInformation, VitalSigns, LabResults, and DiagnosisCodes
- **Hospital Information System**: Stores patient demographics (FullName, DateOfBirth, HomeAddress, InsuranceInformation) and treatment records
- **Clinical Trial Management Platform**: Tracks trial participants with TrialID, ConsentRecords, AdverseEventReports, and TreatmentOutcomes

### Data Aggregation and De-identification
The **Research Data Warehouse** (hosted in us-east-1) aggregates data from:
- 15 hospital networks across US, EU, and Canada
- 200+ clinical trial sites globally
- National health registries from participating countries

De-identification process:
- Remove direct identifiers (Name, SSN, Medical Record Number)
- Generalize quasi-identifiers (Age to age ranges, ZIP codes to regions)
- Apply k-anonymity (k=5) and l-diversity techniques
- Generate synthetic identifiers for longitudinal tracking

### Cross-Border Data Transfers
Patient data flows internationally:
- **EU to US**: Clinical trial data from EU sites transferred to US-based Research Data Warehouse (requires GDPR Article 49 derogation for scientific research)
- **US to Switzerland**: Genomic data shared with Swiss pharmaceutical research labs
- **Canada to UK**: Population health data shared with UK National Health Service for comparative studies

### Third-Party Data Sharing
De-identified datasets shared with:
- **PharmaCorp International** (Switzerland): Receives de-identified clinical trial data including GeneticData, TreatmentOutcomes, and AdverseEventReports for drug efficacy studies
- **University Medical Research Consortium** (Multi-national): Receives anonymized patient cohorts with MedicalHistory, VitalSigns, and LabResults for epidemiological research
- **Government Health Agencies** (US FDA, EMA, Health Canada): Receives adverse event reports and safety surveillance data
- **AI Diagnostics Inc** (US): Receives medical imaging data and DiagnosisCodes to train diagnostic algorithms

### Special Category Data Processing
Processing of sensitive health data:
- Genetic Data
- Mental Health Information
- HIV/AIDS status
- Substance abuse treatment records
- Reproductive health information

### Data Elements Processed
- Full Name (pre-de-identification)
- Date of Birth
- Social Security Number (pre-de-identification)
- Medical Record Number (pre-de-identification)
- Home Address
- Insurance Information
- Medical History
- Prescription Information
- Genetic Data
- Vital Signs
- Lab Results
- Diagnosis Codes
- Treatment Outcomes
- Adverse Event Reports
- Mental Health Information

### Data Subject Types
- Patients
- Clinical Trial Participants (Medical Research Subjects)
- Healthcare Providers (for provider performance data)
- Insurance Beneficiaries

## Legal Basis
- Explicit Consent (for clinical trial participation)
- Public Interest in Public Health (for disease surveillance)
- Scientific Research (under GDPR Article 89)
- Legal Obligation (for adverse event reporting to regulators)

## Cross-Border Transfer Mechanisms
- Standard Contractual Clauses with additional safeguards for health data
- GDPR Article 49 derogations for scientific research
- Binding Corporate Rules for intra-group transfers
- Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals for research protocols

## Data Protection Measures
- End-to-end encryption for data in transit
- Encryption at rest using AES-256
- Role-based access controls with audit logging
- Secure multi-party computation for collaborative analysis
- Differential privacy techniques for aggregate statistics
- Regular privacy impact assessments

## Retention Period
- Identified patient data: Duration of treatment + 10 years (regulatory requirement)
- Clinical trial data: 25 years from trial completion (FDA requirement)
- De-identified research datasets: Indefinite (for scientific reproducibility)
- Genetic data: Subject to specific consent terms, typically 15-20 years

## Data Subject Rights
- Right to withdraw consent for research participation
- Right to access their own health records
- Right to restrict processing (subject to legal obligations)
- Right to object to automated decision-making in diagnosis
- Limited right to erasure (due to scientific research exemptions)

## Ethical Oversight
- Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval required for all research protocols
- Data Safety Monitoring Board reviews for clinical trials
- Ethics committee oversight for international data transfers
- Patient advocacy group consultation for sensitive research areas
