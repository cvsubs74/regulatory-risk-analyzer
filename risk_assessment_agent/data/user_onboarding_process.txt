Business Process: New User Onboarding

This process describes the steps for registering a new user and collecting their initial data and consent.

The key assets involved are the Authentication Service and the User Profile Database.

The Authentication Service manages sensitive credentials and stores the UserID, HashedPassword, and any OAuthTokens associated with the account.

The User Profile Database holds less sensitive information, including the UserID, FullName, DateOfBirth, and a record of their ConsentFlags for marketing and data sharing.
