Business Process: Data Breach Notification

This process outlines the procedure for notifying affected users in the event of a data breach.

It relies on the Incident Management System and the Public Relations Comms Tool.

The Incident Management System is the source of truth for breach details, containing the IncidentID, the AffectedUserCount, and a list of DataCategoriesImpacted (e.g., 'Contact Info', 'Financial Info').

The Public Relations Comms Tool uses this information to populate a NotificationTemplate, which is then sent to a RecipientList generated from the affected user base.
